<h1>Long-running job!</h1>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    Bare minimum requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide us with your example of the simple SPA with .Net 6 on the backend, and Angular/ReactJS on the front-end. On the front-end side user should be able to enter the text into the text field, press the "Convert" button, and get this text encoded into the base64 format.</li>
      <li>Encoding should be performed on the backend side. Encoded string should be returned to the client one character at a time, one by one, and for each returned character there should be random pause on the server 1-5 seconds. All received characters should form a string in a UI textbox, hence it will be updated in real-time by adding new incoming characters</li>
      <li>User cannot start another encoding process while the current one is in progress, but user can press the "cancel" button and thus cancel the currently running process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    Bonus (recommended) requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>Web page should look neat; use Bootstrap or its derivatives</li>
      <li>Use default IoC, package managers and other tools to build & run the app</li>
      <li>Use the latest released .Net & C# with all possible new features they provide</li>
      <li>
        Server-side app should be hosted in Linux Docker container:
        <ul>
          <li>Host API & UI backend in different containers</li>
          <li>Support basic authentication using nginx in another container</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li>Business logic should be implemented as a service, with unit tests for each respectively</li>
      <li>No compiled/build stuff should be provided, only source code is required</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
